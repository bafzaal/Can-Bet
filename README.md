# Can-Bet

On first clone of the repository run 'npm install' in the client-app and server folders.

Please note (For Developers): The API that we are pulling in betting lines from only allows 500 requests per month. The remaining requests is output to the console everytime the user navigates to the betting lines page (for dev mode/purposes only). Once we run out of requests we must either signup again to receive a new API Key which will  reset the requests or we must pay $20 to upgrade our request limit to 20,000 requests per month.
